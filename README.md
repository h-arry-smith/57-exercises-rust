# Exercises for Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills - Rust

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges from the above [book](https://pragprog.com/titles/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers/).

I have previously completed these challenges in [ruby](https://github.com/h-arry-smith/57-exercises-ruby).

Each challenge I completed is it's own cargo bin, with a short name that relates to the names given in the book.

Many of the same caveats from that repository apply here:
- This code hopefully improves throughout the challenges, as my familiarity and understanding of rust develops.
- I have completed less of the challenges than in the ruby challenge. Though I explored web frameworks a little,
  the final challenges of this book have a mostly web-oriented focus and I don't intend to use rust for this
  purpose.
- Code does not aim to be fully featured, but to meet the requirements of the challenge, focus on learning some
  paticular element, and then move on. Proper error handling, tests etc. are a distraction at this learning stage.
  
If you stumble across this, and you have suggestions on how to improve any of the code here, that's greatly appreciated.
